                    The newly created Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre
                    (IN-SPACe),
                    an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) collaboration with the private sector, will boost
                    Indian space exploration and provide a platform to the private companies working in the segment,
                    said union minister Dr. Jitendra Singh.
                    <br /><br />
                    Giving full credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for approving the participation of the private
                    sector in the entire range of space activities, Singh, the minister of state (MoS) for the
                    Department of Space, said more than 25 industries have already approached the Department of Space
                    for undertaking space activities according to the guidelines. "The move to open up the Space sector
                    for private participation was a path-breaking step taken by Prime Minister Modi and has been widely
                    welcomed by leading private players across the country," he said adding, it will boost the goal of
                    India's Aatmanirbhar Bharat.
                    <br /><br />
                    IN-SPACe has been created under the Department of Space as a separate vertical for taking
                    independent decisions with respect to permitting and regulating space activities of the private
                    sector. The proposed range of space activities under the IN-SPACe program includes Small Satellite
                    Launch Vehicle, Geospatial services, Satellite Constellation, Application products, etc.
                    <br /><br />
                    The endeavour is not only to ensure that India becomes a competitive space market but also to ensure
                    that the benefits of the space program reach out to the poorest. This is in keeping with the
                    Centre's principle of planning every reform with the aim to benefit the poorest of the poor and to
                    make India self-reliant through consistent endeavour in the direction of Atmanirbhar Bharat, the MoS
                    said.
                    <br /><br />
                    Singh said, the applications of space technology had, in the last six years, been extended to
                    different areas of infrastructure development as well as to bring ease of living for the common
                    citizen. Space and satellite technology is today being extensively used in railways, road and bridge
                    construction, agriculture sector, housing, tele-medicine, etc, besides disaster management and
                    accurate weather forecast.

                <p class="description">The Indian Army has put forward a proposal to introduce a short stint in the
                    force for youngsters, and the government must waste no time to implement this
                    <br /><br />
                    The Indian Army has come up with a proposal to introduce a three-year stint in the force for
                    youngsters. This proposal is a highly innovative one and will benefit not only the individual, but
                    also the army and society at large.
                    <br /><br />
                    “The army is held in very high esteem by youngsters and while many do not want a career in the
                    force, they would be happy to serve a short stint in the army for the thrill, adventure and pride
                    involved in serving in uniform,” said a senior officer at the NCC Directorate of West Bengal and
                    Sikkim.
                    <br /><br />
                    The officer said that the professional training, discipline, sense of responsibility and duty,
                    strategic thinking ability, team spirit, leadership qualities, conscientiousness and strong sense of
                    patriotism and sacrifice that a person in uniform inculcates while in the force would make him a
                    prime candidate for jobs in the corporate sector and government after the ‘tour of duty’ (ToD) in
                    the army.
                    <br /><br />
                    The army has proposed to recruit 100 youngsters in the officers category and 1,000 as Jawans in the
                    pilot project. The move will drastically cut down the ballooning salaries and pension bill of the
                    country’s armed forces and significantly reduce defence expenditure.
                    <br /><br />
                    There will be no compromise with the existing recruitment criterion and standards for ToD officers
                    and Jawans, who will have to undergo an initial one-year training. At the end of their three-year
                    tenure, they will get an attractive severance package as a lump sum, but will not get any pension.
                    Also, a ToD officer’s or Jawan’s remuneration will be significantly higher than what he would have
                    earned in the private sector or a government job.
                    <br /><br />
                    Another senior officer at the Army Headquarters who had been involved in framing the proposal
                    pointed out that while a fresh graduate or postgraduate earns about Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000 a month
                    on an average, a ToD officer’s salary would be much higher at Rs 80,000 to Rs 90,000.
                    <br /><br />
                    The army has also proposed that a ToD officer would get a lump sum of about Rs 5 to Rs 6 lakh while
                    a ToD Jawan would get Rs 2 to Rs 3 lakh while hanging up his uniform after three exciting years. It
                    has also proposed that the income of ToD officers and Jawans be tax-free.
                    <br /><br />
                    “A young man would ‘retire’ as a ToD officer or Jawan at the age of around 26 years or even less,
                    and would be a very attractive and prime recruit for the government sector and corporates. Such a
                    young man would enjoy a huge advantage over others,” the officer said.
                    <br /><br />
                    “We have also proposed that the government offer preference to such young men and women for jobs in
                    the government sector and PSUs and in case they want to pursue higher studies and other professional
                    courses after their stints in the army, there should be reservations in those for them,” said the
                    officer.
                    <br /><br />
                    The initial recruitment of 100 officers and 1,000 Jawans would be a pilot project of sorts. But what
                    the army also needs to do here is keep the option of offering a short service commission (SSC, of 10
                    years) or even permanent commission (PC) to exceptional ToD officers. And ToD officers ought to have
                    an assured rank of Captain on completion of their three-year tenure.
                    <br /><br />
                    Also, in case a ToD officer or Jawan dies in the line of duty, his or her family and dependants
                    should be given the same benefits, including access to army medical and CSD facilities, that
                    families of SSC or PC officers get.
                    <br /><br />
                    The army proposal notes that the ToD scheme will find many takers since unemployment is high in the
                    country and there has been a “resurgence of nationalism and patriotism” among the youth in India of
                    late.
                    <br /><br />
                    For the army, the gains are manifold. Though the commissioned strength of the army is nearly 50,000
                    officers, there are about 7,500 vacancies in the junior officer ranks. This acute shortage can be
                    met by ToD officers.
                    <br /><br />
                    The senior officer at the Army HQs said that the total cumulative amount the army spends on a SSC
                    officer — cost of pre-commission training, pay, allowances, benefits, gratuity, severance package,
                    leave encashment and other costs is approximately Rs 6 crore.
                    <br /><br />
                    This cost goes up manifold if the SSC officer is absorbed into permanent commission and continues in
                    service until the age of 54 years (the age of retirement for officers of the rank of Colonel).
                    <br /><br />
                    However, the army has calculated it would have to spend about Rs 83 lakh on a ToD officer. The
                    army’s pay and pension bill has been growing exponentially in recent years and now accounts for a
                    whopping 60 per cent of its budgetary allocation.
                    <br /><br />
                    Though the defence budget has grown by 68 per cent over the last five years, defence pensions have
                    increased by a huge 146 per cent in the same period.
                    <br /><br />
                    The army has also proposed induction of personnel from the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) into
                    the army for seven years. These soldiers then return to their parent force, which can utilise the
                    training and expertise such personnel have inculcated during their seven-year stint in the army. And
                    such personnel would draw their pensions from the Union Home Ministry, and not the Ministry of
                    Defence (MoD).
                    <br /><br />
                    Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat has already cleared a proposal to increase the retirement
                    age of Jawans from the present 38 years to 58. That would ensure optimal use of manpower and
                    substantially reduce the army’s pension bill.
                    <br /><br />
                    What is more, the ToD proposal, once its scaled up, will ensure the existence of a ready reserve
                    force that the country can draw on in times of emergencies. And the benefits of having a large
                    number of disciplined, committed, professional, patriotic and hard-working young people (ex-ToD
                    officers and Jawans) in the country cannot be over-emphasised.
                    <br /><br />
                    Defence Minister Rajnath Singh must now ensure that the MoD’s notorious civilian bureaucracy does
                    not sit on the army’s proposals and find faults with them. It should not be yet another case of
                    ‘army proposes, MoD disposes’.
                    <br /><br />
                    After ensuring its quick passage through the bureaucratic maze, Singh should get it passed by the
                    Union Cabinet and implement the proposals at the earliest. He owes this to the army.
                    <br /><br />

                    and his father a colonel in the Indian Army – the officer could not stomach it anymore.
                    <br /><br />
                    “What Sikkim not our territory? What the hell!” he shouted back. Then, as one PLA major moved
                    menacingly towards his senior officer, a captain, the lieutenant flew into him and punched him in
                    the face.

                <p class="description">
                    The Chinese major collapsed with a thud and his name tag came loose – a good souvenir to carry back
                    – but the lieutenant left it alone, as his colleagues pulled him back.
                    <br /><br />
                    After being admonished for a while by senior officers, for provoking a bigger spat, and being
                    congratulated by officers from command and divisional headquarters at Kolkata and Sukna, the
                    lieutenant was preparing for a commendation. But, the senior commanders could not land at Muguthang
                    because of bad weather.
                    <br /><br />
                    This author was unable to retrieve the lieutenant's contact numbers, as he is posted at a forward
                    location, and his officers and his retired colonel father are not willing to share it with the
                    media.
                    <br /><br />
                    One colonel in Sikkim advised this author to "not blow things up too much because if the Chinese
                    feel humiliated, they will create more trouble."
                    <br /><br />
                    Another brigadier, in the 33rd Corps headquarters in Sukna, told this author that the Chinese are in
                    the habit of ‘specific targeting’.
                    <br /><br />
                    In this case, the hierarchy-conscious Chinese could surely target ‘the small Indian lieutenant’ for
                    hitting ‘the big Chinese major’ (meaning a junior hitting a senior officer).
                    <br /><br />
                    His father, the retired colonel, also refused to talk as a media report might 'harm my son's
                    career'.
                    <br /><br />
                    The penchant for secrecy drilled into the soldiers and officers does not go away, even after
                    retirement, and the retired colonel is understandably worried that the media glare on his son may
                    upset the top brass, who want to scale down tensions with the Chinese and not up the ante.

                    But the retired colonel, also an Assam regiment officer like his son, recalls his days, when he
                    captured a hill top in Sumdorong Chu during General K Sundarji's ‘Ops Falcon'. That hilltop is now
                    named after him.
                    <br /><br />
                    "My daughter, also a legal officer in the army, climbed the peak named after her father in 2018 and
                    the local commander called me up to speak to me. He wanted to speak to the officer after whom the
                    peak he is defending is named after," said the lieutenant's father, insisting “we soldiers can
                    discuss our past but not our present, so leave my son out."
                    <br /><br />
                    “The Chinese are no great soldiers, they have a lot going in their favour – logistics, weapons,
                    terrain, and communication. But when it comes to raw courage and strength, determination and
                    patriotism, they just cannot match us,” was all that the retired colonel was prepared to say.
                    <br /><br />
                    “I chased them away from the hill we captured... they were stunned (to see) our braves charging into
                    thick machine gun fire. They just panicked and ran,” he added.
                    <br /><br />
                    On being asked about his son, he said, "I just cannot get his number" and "please speak to his
                    senior officers."
                    <br /><br />
                    "I never share anything about the army on my social media," says an entry in his Facebook page.
                    <br /><br />
                    Much Praise For the Young Soldier Who Took on a Chinese Major
                    <br /><br />
                    Though for diplomatic reasons, the Indian Army will not go ga-ga over the incident and will downplay
                    the whole thing, there is a quiet admiration for the young officer who ‘took on a Chinese major much
                    bigger than him.’
                    <br /><br />
                    "This is exactly the kind of junior commander we need. There is a great tradition of such officers,
                    who lead Indian soldiers into battle. Remember 'Dil Mange More' Vikram Batra,'" said Probal
                    Dasgupta, author of 'Watershed', a book that brilliantly details how the 1967 border battles with
                    the Chinese at Nathu La changed the confidence of the 1962-hit Indian Army and helped it win the
                    1971 war against Pakistan.
                    <br /><br />
                    Dasgupta was also a former Indian Army major and now works as a corporate consultant.
                    <br /><br />
                    The lieutenant's grandfather served in the Royal and then Indian Air Force and retired as Master
                    Warrant Officer. His father, a graduate from St Xaviers College in Kolkata, joined the army in late
                    1970s and did his unit proud in 'Ops Falcon'.
                    <br /><br />
                    His sister, a legal graduate, is a law officer in the Indian Army as well, and is posted at
                    Hyderabad. She had climbed the hill top named after their father, standing at 14,000 feet, in 2018
                    and called the retired colonel from there.
                    <br /><br />
                    The lieutenant, a technical graduate from Bangalore, preferred the infantry and was commissioned in
                    2019. The family has been covered extensively by the media in West Bengal, where it is rare to find
                    three generations in the army.

                    <strong>New Delhi:</strong> The Ministry of Defence has listed procurement of C-295 transport
                    aircraft from Airbus
                    through Make in India, along with the TEJAS MK-1A, indigenous Light Combat Helicopter and upgraded
                    Heron drones from Israel, as the major deals that are to be inked in 2021.
                    <br /><br />
                    While both C-295 and TEJAS deals have been pending for long, the ministry in its annual report said
                    both deals will be inked in the near future.
                    <br /><br />
                    On the TEJAS deal, it said the case for procurement of advanced 83 TEJAS MK-1A from Hindustan
                    Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is at final stage of approval by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS)
                    and contract is “likely to be signed soon”.
                    <br /><br />
                    It is expected that the deal will be signed around next month when India’s air show — Aero India —
                    takes off in Bangalore.
                    <br /><br />
                    “Case of procurement of 56 C-295 from M/s Airbus with participation of an Indian Production Agency
                    for manufacture of 40 aircraft (out of total 56) in India is also at CFA approval stage and contract
                    is likely to be signed in the near future,” the ministry has said in its report.
                    <br /><br />
                    It added that this is a first-of-its-kind deal that envisages the participation of private companies
                    and would prove to be a boost for the Indian defence industry.
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>C-295s To Replace Avro 748 Aircraft</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    The IAF had selected the C-295 as the replacement for its ageing fleet of Avro 748 transport
                    aircraft that first flew in 1961. While the first 16 aircraft are supposed to be built at the Airbus
                    facility in Spain, the remainder are to be manufactured in India by Tata Advanced Systems Limited.
                    <br /><br />
                    C-295 is a multi-role transport aircraft that can carry a maximum payload of 9.25 tonnes. Since its
                    dimensions are smaller than the rest of the IAF’s transport fleet — C 130Js, C-17s and IL-76s — the
                    C295s can take off and land at many air strips where the larger ones can’t.
                    <br /><br />
                    Talking about the upgrade of Israeli drones Heron and the procurement of Light Combat Helicopter
                    from HAL, the ministry said it is “also at advance stage and contracts are likely to be signed in
                    the first quarter of 2021”.
                    <br /><br />
                    <strong>Push Amid LAC Tensions</strong>
                    <br /><br />
                    The upgrade plans came as India is on a shopping spree to ramp up its firepower and surveillance
                    capabilities as the ongoing tensions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
                    <br /><br />
                    According to the plan, the Herons are supposed to be upgraded with laser-guided bombs,
                    precision-guided munitions, and anti-tank missiles.
                    <br /><br />
                    The forces are also planning to equip the drones with better surveillance and reconnaissance
                    capabilities.
                    <br /><br />
                    This is part of a project that has got a sudden push due to the ongoing tensions at the Line of
                    Actual Control.

                    Our tactical-level ISR simply failed to assess or analyse any troop movement along the LAC. The PLA
                    did not even try any deception
                    <br/><br/>
                    What happened in April 2020 on the north bank of Pangong Tso and why were we taken by total
                    surprise? Such questions are being asked in muted tone, lest we rile and fall out of favour with
                    those in power. What has happened on the ground is abject intelligence failure because we failed to
                    read any signs of Chinese intentions.
                    <br/><br/>
                    While we all know that the Chinese maintain high levels of institutional secrecy and the outside
                    world rarely gets a peek into their minds, what is disheartening is that India could not pick up on
                    troop movement and build-up along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). While strategic intelligence is
                    difficult to gather and can often be drastically wrong, it is the tactical-level intelligence
                    failure that aches us the most. The tactical-level intelligence is largely gathered through a simple
                    ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) model—a basic mechanism deployed while holding
                    defences, especially along the borders.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Have We Learnt From The Past?</strong>
                    <br />
                    The Kargil Review Committee did a commendable analysis of the entire conflict of 1999 because it was
                    related to intelligence failures and management of our borders. In its report, the committee
                    lamented the absence of any institutional mechanism governing interactions between different
                    intelligence agencies. Although the heads of different agencies interacted regularly as per SOPs in
                    vogue, they collectively failed to give any input on such a large-scale infiltration by the
                    Pakistani forces. The report was also a scathing criticism of the ‘turf wars’ and the lack of
                    inter-agency cooperation.
                    <br/>
                    Collectively, all agencies failed to see through the deception at work as both the governments
                    (India and Pakistan) were in the process of building peaceful relations. The famous bus diplomacy
                    was a huge media event—the Army believed it was not possible for the Pakistan Army to risk an
                    infiltration through the rugged and inhospitable terrain of Dras and Batalik sectors. Few who spoke
                    of the Pakistani intention of cutting the Kargil-Leh national highway in summer months with a view
                    to isolate Leh and the rest of Ladakh, were quietly snubbed. The intelligence agencies, including
                    the senior leadership, were ‘cognitively predisposed’ into believing the opposite and accordingly
                    fed this ‘make believe’ truth to the Army.
                    <br/>
                    The rude shocks of May 1999, resulted in over 560 soldiers killed in action and injuries to over
                    1,500. Thankfully, the US administration intervened in time and the Army too started winning back
                    the lost ground.
                    <br/>
                    The Kargil Review Committee Report was taken very seriously by the government of the day and for
                    once it appeared that finally India would have resolved its intelligence-related complications.
                    Massive amount of work was done within the government on one side and the armed forces on the other.
                    New structures were created to coordinate intelligence related work. However, all this merely led to
                    new appointments and billets—no visible improvement in quality of strategic or tactical intelligence
                    was achieved.
                    <br/>
                    In last 70 years since our Independence, we have had several major intelligence failures, both at
                    the borders and internally.

                   <strong> External Failures</strong>
                   <br/>
                    From Sri Lanka—where we simply failed to read the minds and intentions of the LTTE, resulting in
                    catastrophic failure as ‘our boys’ turned enemies—to Punjab where the ISI managed to fuel a deadly
                    insurgency in one of India’s most prosperous states, India has paid heavy price for a number of
                    external intelligence failures since Independence. In Punjab, the agencies had failed to give any
                    input to the Army before Operation Blue Star. In Kashmir, while the signs of a growing unrest were
                    quite discernible after the bungling of the 1987 assembly elections, we failed to assess the gravity
                    and sheer audacity of the uprising. The ISI lulled us into slumber and pumped in weapons and
                    ammunition in the Valley that could arm two Infantry Divisions worth of troops.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong> Intenral Failures</strong>
                    <br/>
                    It’s not just external intelligence gathering where India has not performed up to the mark. Even
                    internal intelligence failures have had a deep impact on the national security of the country. Be it
                    the Babri Masjid demolition that led to riots in large parts of the country that shredded India’s
                    social fabric or the hijacking of IC 814 and the subsequent release of Masood Azhar and two other
                    terrorists, intelligence failures have strained India’s progress.
                    <br/>
                    Parliament attack and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks can be termed as two of the biggest intelligence
                    failures. The planning and coordination involved in Parliament attack lasted for nearly eight
                    months, between Pakistan and modules in Delhi, but our agencies had no clue or warning.
                    <br/>
                    PLA Breach Goes Undetected
                    <br/>
                    The summer of 2020 saw a very aggressive and openly belligerent People’s Liberation Army (PLA) flex
                    its muscles on an otherwise peaceful LAC. In hindsight, it can be said that there were indications
                    of such an attitudinal shift for six to eight months. However, our intelligence agencies were
                    probably seeing too much into the political bonhomie between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and
                    Chinese President Xi Jinping, and did not watch closely the developments taking place on the
                    borders.
                    <br/>
                    Our tactical-level ISR simply failed to assess or analyse any troop movement. The PLA, on its part,
                    did not even try any deception or take measures to hide its concentration and subsequent movement of
                    troops. High-altitude troop movement cannot be hidden as soldiers need sufficient time for
                    acclimatisation to simply survive. Tanks, guns and other heavy war equipment too needs to move up
                    along narrow road arteries — these can be constantly kept under surveillance and observation. As the
                    events kept unfolding on the north bank of Pangong Tso, India was just reacting on the ground. The
                    loss of a Commanding Officer and 19 other soldiers added agony to over 90 badly bludgeoned earlier
                    by the PLA troops in riot gear.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong> We Fix Responsibility?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    This is a question often asked by those who wish to see action taken post a crisis. However, our
                    track record is not very good. We have a long tradition of not punishing failures. Not one person in
                    the position of responsibility has ever got sacked for failing, not once has any responsibility been
                    fixed on numerous intelligence-oriented debacles. India is too soft on individuals in higher
                    positions and the same is true of the organisations entrusted with the task of safeguarding the
                    territorial integrity of the country. Deep down, introspection is needed among a plethora of
                    agencies involved in the task of intelligence gathering — Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), National
                    Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Intelligence Bureau (IB),
                    and the Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) among others. Some serious meditation and
                    self-analysis also needs to be done by the border- guarding forces, including the Army and the
                    Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force.
                    <br/>
                    The silver lining amid all these mega intelligence failures is the resilience and fortitude of the
                    Indian soldier who has never let down the nation. He stands tall and motivated even in face of
                    adversity, ready to sacrifice his life, yet again, for the failure of those who are never held
                    accountable.

                    Our tactical-level ISR simply failed to assess or analyse any troop movement along the LAC. The PLA
                    did not even try any deception
                    <br/><br/>
                    What happened in April 2020 on the north bank of Pangong Tso and why were we taken by total
                    surprise? Such questions are being asked in muted tone, lest we rile and fall out of favour with
                    those in power. What has happened on the ground is abject intelligence failure because we failed to
                    read any signs of Chinese intentions.
                    <br/><br/>
                    While we all know that the Chinese maintain high levels of institutional secrecy and the outside
                    world rarely gets a peek into their minds, what is disheartening is that India could not pick up on
                    troop movement and build-up along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). While strategic intelligence is
                    difficult to gather and can often be drastically wrong, it is the tactical-level intelligence
                    failure that aches us the most. The tactical-level intelligence is largely gathered through a simple
                    ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) model—a basic mechanism deployed while holding
                    defences, especially along the borders.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>Have We Learnt From The Past?</strong>
                    <br />
                    The Kargil Review Committee did a commendable analysis of the entire conflict of 1999 because it was
                    related to intelligence failures and management of our borders. In its report, the committee
                    lamented the absence of any institutional mechanism governing interactions between different
                    intelligence agencies. Although the heads of different agencies interacted regularly as per SOPs in
                    vogue, they collectively failed to give any input on such a large-scale infiltration by the
                    Pakistani forces. The report was also a scathing criticism of the ‘turf wars’ and the lack of
                    inter-agency cooperation.
                    <br/>
                    Collectively, all agencies failed to see through the deception at work as both the governments
                    (India and Pakistan) were in the process of building peaceful relations. The famous bus diplomacy
                    was a huge media event—the Army believed it was not possible for the Pakistan Army to risk an
                    infiltration through the rugged and inhospitable terrain of Dras and Batalik sectors. Few who spoke
                    of the Pakistani intention of cutting the Kargil-Leh national highway in summer months with a view
                    to isolate Leh and the rest of Ladakh, were quietly snubbed. The intelligence agencies, including
                    the senior leadership, were ‘cognitively predisposed’ into believing the opposite and accordingly
                    fed this ‘make believe’ truth to the Army.
                    <br/>
                    The rude shocks of May 1999, resulted in over 560 soldiers killed in action and injuries to over
                    1,500. Thankfully, the US administration intervened in time and the Army too started winning back
                    the lost ground.
                    <br/>
                    The Kargil Review Committee Report was taken very seriously by the government of the day and for
                    once it appeared that finally India would have resolved its intelligence-related complications.
                    Massive amount of work was done within the government on one side and the armed forces on the other.
                    New structures were created to coordinate intelligence related work. However, all this merely led to
                    new appointments and billets—no visible improvement in quality of strategic or tactical intelligence
                    was achieved.
                    <br/>
                    In last 70 years since our Independence, we have had several major intelligence failures, both at
                    the borders and internally.
                    <br/><br/>
                   <strong> External Failures</strong>
                   <br/>
                    From Sri Lanka—where we simply failed to read the minds and intentions of the LTTE, resulting in
                    catastrophic failure as ‘our boys’ turned enemies—to Punjab where the ISI managed to fuel a deadly
                    insurgency in one of India’s most prosperous states, India has paid heavy price for a number of
                    external intelligence failures since Independence. In Punjab, the agencies had failed to give any
                    input to the Army before Operation Blue Star. In Kashmir, while the signs of a growing unrest were
                    quite discernible after the bungling of the 1987 assembly elections, we failed to assess the gravity
                    and sheer audacity of the uprising. The ISI lulled us into slumber and pumped in weapons and
                    ammunition in the Valley that could arm two Infantry Divisions worth of troops.
